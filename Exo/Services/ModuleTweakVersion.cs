/// set changed underneath it, so a machine sat on a superseded configuration indefinitely and
/// the orb called the whole rig good to go. Every module had the same hole; Internet is only
/// where it was noticed.
///
/// The version is a hand-set string per module, bumped in the same commit that changes what
/// that module writes. Deriving it from a hash of the apply code was tempting and wrong: a
/// comment edit would then invalidate everyone's state and re-prompt the world for nothing.
